Try and finish the transaction pool P2P communication and you will then understand the problems and fixes.

When does the blockchain need to be synchronized?
Answer: Whenever there is a change in it's state

Hypothetical Scenario:

Node0 sends a transaction, creating some unspent transaction outputs for Node1.

This transaction must be propgated throughout the network. 

What happens if this transaction conflicts with the state of another node?
For example, Node0 uses unspentTxOuts that were already spent in Node1? How 
do we determine which node is correct?

BUG_ENCOUNTERED: left_over_amount is incorrectly calculated. I had a result of -40 when it should have been 40
